##  Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on the Kaggle dataset to distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy.

## üì¶ Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Cats vs Dogs Training8000Test2000  
- **Kaggle Link**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirensk/cats-vs-dogs-training8000test2000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirensk/cats-vs-dogs-training8000test2000)  

The dataset contains 10,000 images:  
- **Training Set**: 8,000 images  
- **Test Set**: 2,000 images  

Images are organized into

`train/cats`

`train/dogs`

`test/cats`

`test/dogs`.

## üß† Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using Keras with TensorFlow backend and consists of:  
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction  
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions  
- Flatten layer to convert 2D matrices into 1D vectors  
- Dense layers for classification
